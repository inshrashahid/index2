<h2>What is website?</h2>
<p> Website is a collection of Web pages (files) coded in HTML that are linked to each other 
and to pages on other sites. A website is run (hosted) on a Web server by the site's owner,
 a Web hosting provider or an Internet service provider (ISP). </P>
<h2>What is coding?</h2>
Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. 
Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions.
 By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. 
You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.


<h2><u>Difference between website design and development:-</u></h2>
<h3><u>Web Design:</u></h3>
<p>Web design involves writing a plan to develop a usable interface design. 
The role of a web designer is as important as the developer, as without an appealing interface 
and wonderful user experience, the development cannot be well experienced and appreciated by the end user.
 Some of the areas covered under web design are:
<br><br>
<b>1)</b>Graphic designing<br>
<b>2)</b>Logo designing<br>
<b>3)</b>Web layout designing<br>
<b>4)</b>Placement of call-to-action buttons on the website<br>
<b>5)</b>Branding<br>
<b>6)</b>Deciding the Color palettes<br>
<h3><u>Web Development</u></h3>
 Web developers are the ones who are responsible in turning these designs into a live fully functional
 website. Web development involves using various web languages and software tools for developing and
 building a website.<br>
<br>
<b>Two types of Web Development</b>
<br>
1)Front End Developers<br>
2)Back End Developers<br><br>
<h3><u>(1) Front End Developers:</u></h3>
 <p>Front-end developers are the bridge between the web designers and back-end developers.
 They work on three main development languages; Hypertext Markup Language <b>(HTML)</b>,
 Cascading Style Sheets <b>(CSS)</b>, and JavaScript <b>(JS)</b>. These languages help in 
developing a full-fledged website.</P>
<h3><u>(2)Back-end Developers:</u></h3>
<p>Back-end development involves controlling the data and requests from the server. If a website contains
 dynamic data, it will require full fledge back-end services. For example websites which require users
 to submit their personal data for creating an account, need to save this data and make it accessible 
for a later stage.Back-end development involves using server languages like<b> PHP or ASP.NET</b>. It also 
involves writing database queries by using languages
 like <b>SQL or MySQL</b>.</P>

<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<b>Hypertext Markup Language</b><br>
A markup language used to structure text and multimedia documents and to set up hypertext links between
 documents, used extensively on the World Wide Web.Each individual piece markup code<b> (which would fall 
between "<" and ">" characters) </b>is referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. 
Some elements come in pairs that
 indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.<br>
<br>

<b>HTML Tags:</b><br>
 HTML tags are used to hold the HTML element.Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element.
 They begin with < symbol and end with > symbol. Whatever written inside<b> < and > are called tags</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>HTML elements:</b><br>
 HTML element holds the content.Elements enclose the contents in between the tags. They consist of some
 kind of structure or expression.It generally consists of a start tag, content and an end tag.<br>
<br>

  HTML attributes are used to describe the characteristic of an HTML element in detail.It always placed in 
the opening tag of an element. It generally provides additional styling (attribute) to the element.<br>
